# Generator Sandbox

You can use this sandbox to develop your shiny generative art applications. It will give you an ideal structure and a GUI to test with.

Full documentation coming very soon, but for now check out the examples directory. You can link each example from index.html to see them running.

You'll need to run the sandbox from a web server - if you need one, we recommend [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server). Point it at the directory you've cloned this repository to and you're cooking on gas.
